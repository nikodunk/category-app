        	<hr>
				<h3>Superjuice tries to solve this problem.</h3>
	        	<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog">Whole Earth Catalog</a>, Superjuice offers tools to quickly compare "green" products by viewing videos, trusted labels and prices.</p>
	        	<p>Superjuice also offers a weekly digest of new product videos.</p>
	        	<p>When readers choose to buy items through our catalog (though not from all categories), we earn small affiliate commissions that support our work.</p>
