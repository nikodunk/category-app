        	<h4><br><b>Hi!</b> I'm Niko, and I have a hard time working out which "green" products to trust. "Green", "natural" & "eco" are often used very loosely.<br><br></h4><br>
        	<hr>
				<h5>Superjuice tries to solve this problem.</h5>
	        	<p>It offers tools to quickly compare labels and prices, and watch product videos to get an overview of which green products to trust and get.</p>
	        	<p>Superjuice also offers a weekly digest of green product videos.</p>
	        	<p>When readers choose to buy any of our picks, we earn affiliate commissions that support our work. This means we have no incentive to prioritize one product over another.</p>
